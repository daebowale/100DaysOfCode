# 100 Days of Code Challange 

Hi dear 👋🏻, I am just started to doing 100 Days of Code Challenge. The 100 Days of Code is a coding challenge created by Alexander Kallaway to encourage people to learn new coding skills. The challenge follows one simple rule: Code for at least an hour each day for 100 consecutive days. I will publish my 100 days of code regularly on GitHub and also sharing what i am learning with you. Thank you :)
